### Day 27, November 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Electronics Shop Hackerrank challenge.

**Thoughts**: Today was good. Even if it wasn't a very hard challenge, I was able to complete it entirely by myself. I went to a quiet spot and was really able to think. Then, I looked up more optimized solutions. I learned some valuable lessons. The first times didn't succeed, but I was able to think about why the test cases failed and solve the problems by looking at my own code.
