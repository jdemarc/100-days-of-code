### Day 27, November 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Electronics Shop Hackerrank challenge.

**Thoughts**: Today was good. Even if it wasn't a very hard challenge, I was able to complete it entirely by myself. I went to a quiet spot and was really able to think. Then, I looked up more optimized solutions. I learned some valuable lessons. The first times didn't succeed, but I was able to think about why the test cases failed and solve the problems by looking at my own code.

### Day 28, November 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on SQL questions and reviewed databases and their relationships today.

**Thoughts**: Today was more about reviewing some older material I learned in GA's boot camp. I feel much more comfortable with the SQL selects now, that's for sure.

### Day 29, November 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I solved three Hackerrank Challenges today.

**Thoughts**: The difficulty of these challenges seems completely random. Maybe I'll have no idea how to approach them, or maybe I know exactly how to approach them. Sometimes, if I revisit the challenge after a day, I have better successs. Maybe I'm unconsciously thinking about it. It feels good to find the solution, but I don't feel particularly rewarded (lately).

### Day 30, November 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed 25% to 29% of the FCC functional programming lessons.

**Thoughts**: To be honest, I felt a bit sleepy today. I was able to complete the challenges. Some required Google, but I did not need to cheat and look at any answers. I consider that a win. Also, I have a good understanding of how to create your own objects using the map function now.

### Day 31, November 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed from 29% to x% of the FCC functional programming lessons.

**Thoughts**: I found that an answer I had yesterday did work, but there were better solutions. It's probably best that even if I get the correct answer I go back and check FCC's answers. So I'll make that a habit. I usually do, but I guess I missed it this time.
