### Day 65, January 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added an obstacle that falls on screen.

**Thoughts**: Another good day. Although I am closely following the tutorial, I am trying to customize it a bit to make it different and show some kind of understanding of what's going on. Tomorrow will be a bit more independent as I want to incorporate randomness with the obstacles to really add 'something else'. The last line makes me feel like I'm on a cooking show.

### Day 66, January 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added game over mechanics. (touching obstacle, touching edge of screen)

**Thoughts**: The bulk of the game appears done. If you move the ship to the edge if the screen or you collide with an obstacle, the game ends. There is some cleaning up to do however. Also, I don't know how far I'd like to go in terms of cleaning up (aesthetically). But, I do feel good. It's a cheap little game.

### Day 67, January 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added 'Game Over' to screen. Stop obstacles on impact. Stop generation of new obstacles on impact. Add fake replay button. Adjust styling.

**Thoughts**: The game is coming along nicely. Two things are for sure though. I want to be able to hit a replay button, and I want to make it look more fun. It's starting to get a bit more hectic by adding other features because they're all being added through createElement. Things are becoming less DRY, and I don't like that. But with a few images it could look like the real deal.

### Day 68, January 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a 'replay' button.

**Thoughts**: I wanted to do something with a replay button that was added to the DOM and reset the game container, but it was giving me a lot of trouble. When I googled how to reset the browser, [Dummies](https://www.dummies.com/programming/programming-games/how-to-reset-your-html5-game/) gave me a simple trick to update the location.href to an empty string. This clears out any appended children by refreshing the browser. I don't know if this is a good or bad method, but it works pretty well!
