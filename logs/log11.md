### Day 65, January 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added an obstacle that falls on screen.

**Thoughts**: Another good day. Although I am closely following the tutorial, I am trying to customize it a bit to make it different and show some kind of understanding of what's going on. Tomorrow will be a bit more independent as I want to incorporate randomness with the obstacles to really add 'something else'. The last line makes me feel like I'm on a cooking show.
