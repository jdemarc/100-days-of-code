### Day 65, January 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added an obstacle that falls on screen.

**Thoughts**: Another good day. Although I am closely following the tutorial, I am trying to customize it a bit to make it different and show some kind of understanding of what's going on. Tomorrow will be a bit more independent as I want to incorporate randomness with the obstacles to really add 'something else'. The last line makes me feel like I'm on a cooking show.

### Day 66, January 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added game over mechanics. (touching obstacle, touching edge of screen)

**Thoughts**: The bulk of the game appears done. If you move the ship to the edge if the screen or you collide with an obstacle, the game ends. There is some cleaning up to do however. Also, I don't know how far I'd like to go in terms of cleaning up (aesthetically). But, I do feel good. It's a cheap little game.
