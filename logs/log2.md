# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6, November 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my ip-address-tracker app. Got the header, input, and button styled. I'm working on styling the panel where the info goes now.

**Thoughts**: Flexbox is pretty nice, but it doesn't solve everything.. I still need to work with position attributes in CSS to fully master them, so I'm glad I get to incorporate it into the project. I anticipate issues rendering the API results into the info panel, but that's for a later time.

### Day 7, November 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Closed up the IP tracker for now. I am able to query the API, display its elements, and there are no serious bugs I could find. It looks clean, but there is always room for improvement.

**Thoughts**: CSS and alignment gets pretty tricky when it's boxes inside boxes... inside more boxes. I definitely need to work on it some more, but I did learn some things about position and the z-axis in this lesson. In the spirit of not dwelling, I'm going to be moving forward for FCC lessons after this.
