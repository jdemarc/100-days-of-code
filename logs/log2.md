# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6, November 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my ip-address-tracker app. Got the header, input, and button styled. I'm working on styling the panel where the info goes now.

**Thoughts**: Flexbox is pretty nice, but it doesn't solve everything.. I still need to work with position attributes in CSS to fully master them, so I'm glad I get to incorporate it into the project. I anticipate issues rendering the API results into the info panel, but that's for a later time.

### Day 7, November 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Closed up the IP tracker for now. I am able to query the API, display its elements, and there are no serious bugs I could find. It looks clean, but there is always room for improvement.

**Thoughts**: CSS and alignment gets pretty tricky when it's boxes inside boxes... inside more boxes. I definitely need to work on it some more, but I did learn some things about position and the z-axis in this lesson. In the spirit of not dwelling, I'm going to be moving forward for FCC lessons after this.

### Day 8, November 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed FCC's basic data structure lesson.  Topics covered included... arrays and array methods (push, unshift, pop, shift, splice, slice), use of the spread operator, and indexOf(). The second half of the lesson dealt with object manipulation using bracket and dot notation, the delete keyword, hasOwnProperty(), for...in, and Object.keys().

Completed the first two basic algorithm scripting challenges.

**Thoughts**: Definitely good review playing with splice and slice and manipulating objects. I feel like I can never get enough review of it, but I'm sure eventually it'll settle in. I need to make some kind of jingle to remember push and unshift/pop and shift. I did code challenges earlier this morning, but the ones I just completed were extremely simple in comparison.
