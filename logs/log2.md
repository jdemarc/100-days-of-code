# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6, November 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my ip-address-tracker app. Got the header, input, and button styled. I'm working on styling the panel where the info goes now.

**Thoughts**: Flexbox is pretty nice, but it doesn't solve everything.. I still need to work with position attributes in CSS to fully master them, so I'm glad I get to incorporate it into the project. I anticipate issues rendering the API results into the info panel, but that's for a later time.

### Day 7, November 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Closed up the IP tracker for now. I am able to query the API, display its elements, and there are no serious bugs I could find. It looks clean, but there is always room for improvement.

**Thoughts**: CSS and alignment gets pretty tricky when it's boxes inside boxes... inside more boxes. I definitely need to work on it some more, but I did learn some things about position and the z-axis in this lesson. In the spirit of not dwelling, I'm going to be moving forward for FCC lessons after this.

### Day 8, November 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed FCC's basic data structure lesson.  Topics covered included... arrays and array methods (push, unshift, pop, shift, splice, slice), use of the spread operator, and indexOf(). The second half of the lesson dealt with object manipulation using bracket and dot notation, the delete keyword, hasOwnProperty(), for...in, and Object.keys().

Completed the first two basic algorithm scripting challenges.

**Thoughts**: Definitely good review playing with splice and slice and manipulating objects. I feel like I can never get enough review of it, but I'm sure eventually it'll settle in. I need to make some kind of jingle to remember push and unshift/pop and shift. I did code challenges earlier this morning, but the ones I just completed were extremely simple in comparison.

### Day 9, November 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the basic algorithm scripting challenges at FreeCodeCamp. Completed "Find the Longest Word in a String", "Factorialize a Number", "Return Largest Number in Arrays", "Confirm the Ending", "Repeat a String Repeat a String", "Truncate a String". 

**Thoughts**: Got a good rep in on using slice and recursion. I feel much more comfortable with them than before. The challenges weren't too bad, but I'm sure they'll get harder. I feel pretty decent for being able to complete them with relative ease.

### Day 10, November 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Front End Library SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) lesson, basic algorithm scripting challenge 'Finders Keepers', 'Boo who', 'Title Case a Sentence'.

**Thoughts**: SASS was a new library for me, so it was nice to get a bit of exposure. It doesn't seem very difficult, and it appears pretty organized. I like the ability to nest elements. The challenges today were increasingly difficult, but I was able to find some solutions and compare my answer to FCC's. I would like to work on forEach loops, so I hope there is a lesson on that soon.

### Day 11, November 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I got a little bit of time working with Cypress. I actually started yesterday, but did other things as well. I got through a few tutorials and started trying to apply it to one of my projects, Parley.

**Thoughts**: Cypress seems pretty useful really... I mean, it's automated testing. I really like how I can create a cypress code base that I can use to test any of my projects. But, to be honest, I didn't get as much progress as I would have hoped. One of the tests does not work when it's separated out, so that's something I'll have to investigate.

### Day 12, November 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still working through Cypress tutorial, but not much progress was made. The tutorial is only about a year old, but the code does not seem to run as well.

**Thoughts**: Although I'm not making large code submissions or frequent commits during this time, I'm learning quite a bit through actual troubleshooting. The tutorial tests don't run as intended, so I have to figure out why!
