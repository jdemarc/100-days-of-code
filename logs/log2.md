# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6, November 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on my ip-address-tracker app. Got the header, input, and button styled. I'm working on styling the panel where the info goes now.

**Thoughts**: Flexbox is pretty nice, but it doesn't solve everything.. I still need to work with position attributes in CSS to fully master them, so I'm glad I get to incorporate it into the project. I anticipate issues rendering the API results into the info panel, but that's for a later time.
