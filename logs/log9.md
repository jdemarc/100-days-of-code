### Day 53, December 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued with regular expressions following some long days of travel. I touched on lazy matching, using the question mark (?), the anchor character ($), the shorthand for alphanumeric (\w), and some not-even-challenge challenges using the negative set (^) and one or more (+) matching.

**Thoughts**: Today was pretty boring. I'm out for the holidays so I wanted to keep it simple and see where it goes. I have once before went over this type of stuff for regular expressions so really this is just review. I recognize my setting can and will change, and I'm going to need to adapt and continue working. So, here's to day one of that experience.

### Day 54, December 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I walked through the Picking Numbers Hackerrank challenge.

**Thoughts**: Today was... difficult. Definitely a harder day than usual, but I'm managing to gather small bits of information from challenges I can't solve myself. Thinking outside the box or from different perspectives is something that will take time.

### Day 55, December 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on FCC coding challenges and deployed a project from my coding bootcamp to Heroku.

**Thoughts**: The challenges weren't as fulfilling as I hoped. They were small in terms of 'requirements', so if you looked up how to do something, it essentially gave you the answer to the challenge. It was good exposure either way though. The deploying part of today was because yesterday someone had asked me about it, and we couldn't get it to work. But, today, I was able to deploy it in less than ten minutes. It makes me curious what was going wrong.
