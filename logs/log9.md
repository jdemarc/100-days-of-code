### Day 53, December 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued with regular expressions following some long days of travel. I touched on lazy matching, using the question mark (?), the anchor character ($), the shorthand for alphanumeric (\w), and some not-even-challenge challenges using the negative set (^) and one or more (+) matching.

**Thoughts**: Today was pretty boring. I'm out for the holidays so I wanted to keep it simple and see where it goes. I have once before went over this type of stuff for regular expressions so really this is just review. I recognize my setting can and will change, and I'm going to need to adapt and continue working. So, here's to day one of that experience.

### Day 54, December 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I walked through the Picking Numbers Hackerrank challenge.

**Thoughts**: Today was... difficult. Definitely a harder day than usual, but I'm managing to gather small bits of information from challenges I can't solve myself. Thinking outside the box or from different perspectives is something that will take time.
