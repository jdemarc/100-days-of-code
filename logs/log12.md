### Day 71, January 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I solved the coding challenge called Palindrome on FCC's cirriculum.

**Thoughts**: It's kind of nice coming back to coding challenges. It's clean, doesn't have many strings attached, and this time I was able to solve it by myself. Maybe I'm actually getting better! Some things to note as relates to coding... reverse changes the original array. Arrays shouldn't be compared for equality.
