### Day 71, January 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I solved the coding challenge called Palindrome on FCC's cirriculum.

**Thoughts**: It's kind of nice coming back to coding challenges. It's clean, doesn't have many strings attached, and this time I was able to solve it by myself. Maybe I'm actually getting better! Some things to note as relates to coding... reverse changes the original array. Arrays shouldn't be compared for equality.

### Day 72, January 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I worked on your traditional Caesar cipher problem.

**Thoughts**: I was a little annoyed today, and it definitely was not helpful to the process. I remembered that I've done a cipher before, and there was the issue with the alphabet looping (subtracting 13 from 78 or below). Well, here it was again! It is also apparent that regular expressions are very powerful... as they are used in almost every challenge.
