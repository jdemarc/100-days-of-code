# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
To get started, I began by blazing through freecodecamp.org's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.  I started at 0 percent and ended at 32%. If I learned anything, it was concretely that strings are immutable. Worth? I think so.  Otherwise, the session was spent mostly revisiting proper terminology (for example, 'assignment operator')

**Thoughts:**
I could have easily started at a much more difficult spot. But, I wanted to kind of ease myself into it.  Without a doubt, things will become challenging quickly. I think it's vitally important for me to understand every aspect of the basics before I continue so that's why I decided to start where I did. In terms of how I felt, I felt like I was kind of wasting my time. At the same time, this is a new thing so a large part of it is simply developing the habit.

### Day 1: October 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
I made some good progress again today. Started back up with arrays. I managed to go from 32% to 66%. I know it's not a race, but I feel pretty eager to get back to the challenging stuff. Today's session went over some basic array manipulation, how to access elements, function declaration and invocation, and conditional logic.

**Thoughts**:
Take-aways... shift removes stuff from the front of an array, unshift adds stuff to the front of an array. Parameters are not arguments. Strict equality/inequality versus non-strict. Logic matters when performing if else statements. Still slightly feeling behind the curve, but you gotta have your basics down. I'll feel better once I move onto objects and ES6 stuff.

### Day 2, Session 1: October 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Started at 66% and end at 84% of FCC's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. I briefly reviewed switch statements and then got into objects. I reviewed objects and how to access, update, and delete them. I completed a few challenges and organized my material a bit more.
Switch Statements, Objects

**Thoughts**:
Finally, I got to start thinking a bit more critically. I'm practicing a cycle of "do it, do it right, and do it better" which I definitely was able to use for the two challenges I got done today. I spent a bit more time than an hour today, but that's because I wanted to really check out the answers to the challenges and understand the improved solutions.

### Day 2, Session 2: October 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Had the time, so I figured I'd keep coding. Percentage wise, I went from 84 to 92. I finished another challenge using loops and objects, and I make sure I can repeat them a few times. I also got to review recursion a bit.

**Thoughts**:
Manipulating objects in a realistic way does not seem very intuitive to me. But, it just means I need to practice them more. I think I solidified my understanding of the recursive base case at least.

### Day 3, Session 1: October 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Fully completed the Basic JavaScript portion of FCC's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures lesson. The last 8 percent dealt with random numbers, parseInt, the ternary operator, and a bit more recursion.

**Thoughts**:
While I'm still technically just reviewing, it felt pretty good to easily complete the final recursive challenge (despite struggling a bit with the previous). It really does take some thinking outside the box to find certain solutions. I definitely learned a thing or two throughout this lesson, and I think it'll stick better since I've done it before.

### Day 3, Session 2: October 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Started ES6 module. 0% - 52%. Reviewed: var and let, comparing scope of var and let, const, arrow functions (without parameters, with parameters, default parameters), rest parameters, spread operator, destructuring assignment (objects, arrays, functions).

**Thoughts**:
Back to a bit of review, but it was much needed. Knowing these foundations will help me program with confidence. Not knowing the specific difference between simple variable declarations is a bit embarassing, but now I know better and have notes to look back on. Rest parameters, the spread operator, and destructuring will need to be reviewed once again for sure. It certainly makes your code look better!

### Day 4, Session 1: October 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Completed the ES6 module. Lessons went over...
template literals, object literals, concise declarative functions, class syntax, getters and setters, module script, import and named, default exporting, import * as, promises.

**Thoughts**:
I felt pretty good with the content of today. I'm a bit curious about getters and setters since I have not seen them used in practice (except in Java, C++). I'm glad I got a bit more explanation on the finer details of importing and exporting and promises. I'm fairly proud with the progress so far. Although the subject matter was not very difficult, I will be taking some time today to look over it all again because I think it is important... especially promises.

### Day 5, October 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Yesterday, I started up a new repo and started working on a front-end project. Well... maybe not a project, but an app. It's an ip address tracker. When you enter an IP address, it displays a map of the location. I am up to the point where I can query the api, geo.ipify.org, to obtain location information and use that information to generate a map using Leaflet.js and Mapbox.

**Thoughts**:
I haven't visited a pure front end project in a bit of time, so I had to ease back into it. Lots of googling for sure. I am also having to juggle 2 api keys, which from my research, cannot be maintained as a secret (as with Node.js and using dotenv). I almost scrapped it all and spun up an express app, but I didn't want to have to get a database involved.
