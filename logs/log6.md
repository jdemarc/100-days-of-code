### Day 34, November 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed a few reduce/filter challenges and started working with the sort method. Still working on functional programming and reinforcing its concepts. Up to 75% on the FCC lesson.

**Thoughts**: Reduce is still tricky. I think I'm getting the hang of it -- for doing things like creating arrays and such -- but it's a work in progress. I may need to watch a few videos. I'm trying to turn whatever functions I can into reduce functions as practice.

### Day 35, November 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working through FCC's functional programming 'course', I went from 75% to completion. I covered the following methods... split, join, every, and some. I also visited regular expressions briefly and touched on currying and partial applications.

**Thoughts**: I feel that most of today was a review, but I felt good about reinforcing the topics. I am still particularly confused by what currying/partial applications is used for. I'll take some time outside of the challenge to do some googling.
