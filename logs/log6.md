### Day 34, November 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed a few reduce/filter challenges and started working with the sort method. Still working on functional programming and reinforcing its concepts. Up to 75% on the FCC lesson.

**Thoughts**: Reduce is still tricky. I think I'm getting the hang of it -- for doing things like creating arrays and such -- but it's a work in progress. I may need to watch a few videos. I'm trying to turn whatever functions I can into reduce functions as practice.
