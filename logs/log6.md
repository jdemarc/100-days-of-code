### Day 34, November 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed a few reduce/filter challenges and started working with the sort method. Still working on functional programming and reinforcing its concepts. Up to 75% on the FCC lesson.

**Thoughts**: Reduce is still tricky. I think I'm getting the hang of it -- for doing things like creating arrays and such -- but it's a work in progress. I may need to watch a few videos. I'm trying to turn whatever functions I can into reduce functions as practice.

### Day 35, November 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working through FCC's functional programming 'course', I went from 75% to completion. I covered the following methods... split, join, every, and some. I also visited regular expressions briefly and touched on currying and partial applications.

**Thoughts**: I feel that most of today was a review, but I felt good about reinforcing the topics. I am still particularly confused by what currying/partial applications is used for. I'll take some time outside of the challenge to do some googling.

### Day 36, December 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed two of the intermediate algorithm scripting challenges at FCC. The first one was to find the sum of the range between two numbers, inclusive.  The second was to find the set difference between two arrays.

**Thoughts**: I was able to complete the first challenge without any issues. Just good ole thinking. The second one I struggled with, and went to check out google. I tried some of those, but it wasn't giving me what I was looking for.  After looking at the hints from FCC, I was able to figure it out. Just being given the methods helped significantly.
