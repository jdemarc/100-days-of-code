### Day 58, December 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with regular expressions (almost done!).
Topics: 
- whitespace matching (\s)
- nonwhitespace matching (\S)
- quantity specifiers ({})
- quantity specifiers with no upper limit({3,})
- quantity specifier with specific limit ({3})

**Thoughts**: Today was a nice introduction back into my routine following time away.. I'm hoping to wrap up regular expressions, maybe use them a little, and get into a project of time kind.

### Day 59, December 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed FCC's regular expression lesson.

Topics: 
- Optional elements (?)
- Lookaheads (?=..., ?!...)
- Mixed grouping (P(engu|umpki)n)
- Capture groups (\1\2...)
- .replace()

**Thoughts**: Capture group lesson just before replace method talks about not repeating matches, but then repeats matches in the replace method. In most cases, I think FCC does a good job at progressing to the next challenge or lesson. Today, I didn't feel that way. I think there were 'leaps' that needed to be built on more. But-- maybe it's just me, and I wasn't in the most excited mood. I'm hoping that changes and I can better mentally prepare myself for the sessions.

### Day 60, December 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on a challenge, arguments optional. It is incomplete.

**Thoughts**: I'm taking a bit more time today and next session to really think about this challenge. I'm back again trying not to default to looking up the answer, and I really felt I was able to more deeply think today. I may not have the answer yet, but it is leading me to explore different things... arguments, functions, and other important JavaScript.

### Day 61, December 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Walked through solution to Arguments Optional, Make A Person, and staged for the last one, Map the Debris. This required some reading about orbital periods.

**Thoughts**: Although I didn't quite solve the first challenge of the day, I walked through it very slowly, and it made sense without any issue. For the second challenge, one thing I find difficult is when variables are set to functions. It's the syntax that messes me up. I'm fairly confident that, when I get to a company, the syntax will be uniform and much easier to get used to and stick to. But, I shouldn't let that be a basis... I should be exposed to all kinds of syntaxes.

### Day 62, December 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I walked through the Map Debris challenge. I started watching a tutorial for some simple browser games. In particular, Flappy Bird.

**Thoughts**: I'm going to try to do a bit of a fun project coming up to keep things interesting. I'm going to start by watching a tutorial and see if I can make a game more 'my own'.

### Day 63, January 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I set up the boilerplate for a new project, pixel dodge. I added files and styling. I should begin some JavaScript tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I feel fairly good about this little project. It will be sort of a vertically oriented, modified flappy bird. It's nothing really crazy, but it's different than coding challenges and gets me back using DOM elements (which has been a little bit). It also makes me go back to CSS. We'll see what happens!
