### Day 58, December 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued with regular expressions (almost done!).
Topics: 
- whitespace matching (\s)
- nonwhitespace matching (\S)
- quantity specifiers ({})
- quantity specifiers with no upper limit({3,})
- quantity specifier with specific limit ({3})

**Thoughts**: Today was a nice introduction back into my routine following time away.. I'm hoping to wrap up regular expressions, maybe use them a little, and get into a project of time kind.

### Day 59, December 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed FCC's regular expression lesson.

Topics: 
- Optional elements (?)
- Lookaheads (?=..., ?!...)
- Mixed grouping (P(engu|umpki)n)
- Capture groups (\1\2...)
- .replace()

**Thoughts**: Capture group lesson just before replace method talks about not repeating matches, but then repeats matches in the replace method. In most cases, I think FCC does a good job at progressing to the next challenge or lesson. Today, I didn't feel that way. I think there were 'leaps' that needed to be built on more. But-- maybe it's just me, and I wasn't in the most excited mood. I'm hoping that changes and I can better mentally prepare myself for the sessions.
