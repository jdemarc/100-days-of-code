### Day 77, January 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I started working on a Frontend mentor project. It's a launch countdown timer.

**Thoughts**: It feels good to be commiting things more than once. It also feels good to get icons positioned nicely on a page. I should have taken more time to prepare for this project in terms of organization. I kind of jumped in and started styling, and I told myself I'd worry about the countdown aspect later. Either way, I am making things happen. Before tomorrow I'll take some time to consider how to approach the project further.
