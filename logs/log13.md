### Day 77, January 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I started working on a Frontend mentor project. It's a launch countdown timer.

**Thoughts**: It feels good to be commiting things more than once. It also feels good to get icons positioned nicely on a page. I should have taken more time to prepare for this project in terms of organization. I kind of jumped in and started styling, and I told myself I'd worry about the countdown aspect later. Either way, I am making things happen. Before tomorrow I'll take some time to consider how to approach the project further.

### Day 78, January 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I more or less completed the countdown timer.

**Thoughts**: This project was called intermediate, but it only took me two hours or so to complete. I'm strongly considering adding cards which adjust the timer and consideration for mobile. Flexboxes make things easier, I think, but they require a few layers of nesting to properly center.

### Day 79, January 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I started with FreeCodeCamp's Bootstrap challenges. I completed several Salesforce developer modules.

**Thoughts**: I was indecisive today. I spent several hours working on Salesforce developer lessons. Then I looked around at Frontend Mentor challenges to see if anything peaked my interest. I decided to re-practice Bootstrap through FreeCodeCamp since I have been spending most of my sessions with them.

### Day 80, January 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I completed 32% of FCC's Bootstrap lesson.

**Thoughts**: I feel that Bootstrap was something I really experimented with while I was in my software engineering boot camp. Personally, I really like it. It's super convenient, gets rid of almost all of my custom CSS, and to me is intuitive. The references for Bootstrap are also very user friendly. The only thing I worry about with Bootstrap is if there is anything performance related to adding a bunch of classes to an element. I would think not? but I'd have to look it up.

### Day 81, January 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I completed up to 71% of FCC's Bootstrap lesson.

**Thoughts**: It's starting to come back to me. Put everything in a row, and then put each thing in a column. Bootstrap uses 12 as it's column divisions. Although very 'simple', it can be repetitive. If you have an app with a lot of choices or columns, you will be nesting things into columns fairly often. I'm also a pretty large fan of how easy it is to center things wih text-center and make things responsive with container-fluid. I realize this isn't a super challenging lesson, but it should be wrapped up by tomorrow and I can go back to something a little more testing.
