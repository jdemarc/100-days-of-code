### Day 41, December 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was able to fix some conditional rendering. I was also able to fix revealing a button on hover.

**Thoughts**: I'm not entirely sure why, but using display:none and display:block versus visibility:hidden and visibility:visible is different and causes different results. It felt good to get one working when the other did not however.  Just lots of plug and play.  The app looks decent. I just need to keep plugging away at it.
