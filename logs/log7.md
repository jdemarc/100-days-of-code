### Day 41, December 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was able to fix some conditional rendering. I was also able to fix revealing a button on hover.

**Thoughts**: I'm not entirely sure why, but using display:none and display:block versus visibility:hidden and visibility:visible is different and causes different results. It felt good to get one working when the other did not however.  Just lots of plug and play.  The app looks decent. I just need to keep plugging away at it.

### Day 42, December 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on adding a new component called ActionBar.  This will display the number of todos, filter todos based on active/completed/all, and clear completed todos. I'm able to clear completed todos and the action bar is more or less styled.

**Thoughts**: I felt that I didn't get much done today, but I did get something done. I guess I'm just baby-stepping it. I need to think pretty deeply about how I want to filter the all/active/completed todos.. but I'll figure out something.
