### Day 48, December 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the debugging lesson, a coding challenge, and some regular expression lesson(s)?

**Thoughts**: I wanted to complete the debugging lessons for the sake of completing them. There were only 6 left and they were not very difficult. So, I did that first. Then, I wanted to complete a coding challenge. I had the right mindset, and I was able to complete it. I knew what to do but not how to do it so I used google to check out actual implementation. I think this is a pretty big step, and I might be under appreciating this... but here I am acknowledging it at least.

### Day 49, December 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was able to complete one coding challenge, replacing special characters, but I wasn't able to complete the fibonacci challenge. I instead walked through it.

**Thoughts**: I'm distracted by my failure with the second challenge to appreciate the fact I managed the first. The fibonacci sequence is always one that makes me cringe. Which, really, means I should be spending more time on it and melding it into my brain. More on that later!

### Day 50, December 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was able to complete the sum of all primes challenge. I made some progress with the second challenge, finding the LCM of a range of numbers.

**Thoughts**: It seems that I am always able to solve one challenge and not the next. Maybe it's the way the 'cirriculum' is set up where one challenge is easier than the next and it alternates. Probably thinking too much into it... The first challenge was much of the same where I knew what to do algorithm wise, I just needed to look up the implementation. (Things like, is 1 a prime or two or negative numbers were also things looked up). Today was a lot of math, and I should expect that with coding.  Today was also unique because I will be working to continue completing a challenge tomorrow.

### Day 51, December 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I stepped through the smallest common multiple challenge, and I solved the 'drop it' challenge.

**Thoughts**: The theme seems the same... one easier challenge, one harder. Probably intentional. In any case, I tried to do something a little bit different this time and continue where I left off on a challenge. While it didn't let me completely solve the challenge, I found I was much more patient and understanding of it when I returned to it. I was able to walk through the challenge and really understand why it was solved the way it was... even down to the reversed loop. So, I do feel good about that. For the other challenge, I was able to solve it my own way. That's always a win for me. But, taking time to check website's solutions is always humbling.

### Day 52, December 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued with regular expression lessons today. I went over matching a range of numbers and letters using a hyphen (a-z), negative character sets (^), matching a character that appears one or more times (+), and matching a character zero or more times (*). I also solved the 'Find Digits' challenge at Hackerrank.

**Thoughts**: The regular expression lessons are important but very small. It's more like trying to memorize vocab even though its just symbols. It's good to review what can be done with them, but I think each case will be quite specific, and if I remember correctly there are lists to extract information you want practically (such as e-mail, phone number, etc). Still, it can't hurt. I broke up the lessons with a Hackerrank problem, which, I was able to solve! I think I'm getting a little bit better with this stuff.

### Day 53, December 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued with regular expressions following some long days of travel. I touched on lazy matching, using the question mark (?), the anchor character ($), the shorthand for alphanumeric (\w), and some not-even-challenge challenges using the negative set (^) and one or more (+) matching.

**Thoughts**: Today was pretty boring. I'm out for the holidays so I wanted to keep it simple and see where it goes. I have once before went over this type of stuff for regular expressions so really this is just review. I recognize my setting can and will change, and I'm going to need to adapt and continue working. So, here's to day one of that experience.
