### Day 48, December 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the debugging lesson, a coding challenge, and some regular expression lesson(s)?

**Thoughts**: I wanted to complete the debugging lessons for the sake of completing them. There were only 6 left and they were not very difficult. So, I did that first. Then, I wanted to complete a coding challenge. I had the right mindset, and I was able to complete it. I knew what to do but not how to do it so I used google to check out actual implementation. I think this is a pretty big step, and I might be under appreciating this... but here I am acknowledging it at least.

### Day 49, December 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was able to complete one coding challenge, replacing special characters, but I wasn't able to complete the fibonacci challenge. I instead walked through it.

**Thoughts**: I'm distracted by my failure with the second challenge to appreciate the fact I managed the first. The fibonacci sequence is always one that makes me cringe. Which, really, means I should be spending more time on it and melding it into my brain. More on that later!
