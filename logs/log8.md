### Day 48, December 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed the debugging lesson, a coding challenge, and some regular expression lesson(s)?

**Thoughts**: I wanted to complete the debugging lessons for the sake of completing them. There were only 6 left and they were not very difficult. So, I did that first. Then, I wanted to complete a coding challenge. I had the right mindset, and I was able to complete it. I knew what to do but not how to do it so I used google to check out actual implementation. I think this is a pretty big step, and I might be under appreciating this... but here I am acknowledging it at least.
