**Today's Progress**: Completed 56% of FCC's jQuery lesson

**Thoughts**: I never really had formal training on jQuery, but I have always heard about it. This lesson, although pretty introductory, does a a decent job of introducing the library.  Some of the topics that were introduced include selecting by type ('button'), class ('.btn'), or id ('#target1'). Some functions introduced included addClass(), removeClass(), .css(), .prop(), .html(), .text(). My thoughts are, if you can select things normally without a library, why make your codebase bigger by importing jQuery?

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's jQuery lesson.

**Thoughts**: The next day of jQuery showed me a few more things I hadn't seen before. Functions such as... .remove(), .appendTo(), .clone(), .parent(), .children(). I get the feeling you can do some pretty powerful selections from what I've seen. I'm still a bit curious about the library since this was only about 18 mini challenges.
