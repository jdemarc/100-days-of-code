**Today's Progress**: Completed 56% of FCC's jQuery lesson

**Thoughts**: I never really had formal training on jQuery, but I have always heard about it. This lesson, although pretty introductory, does a a decent job of introducing the library.  Some of the topics that were introduced include selecting by type ('button'), class ('.btn'), or id ('#target1'). Some functions introduced included addClass(), removeClass(), .css(), .prop(), .html(), .text(). My thoughts are, if you can select things normally without a library, why make your codebase bigger by importing jQuery?

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's jQuery lesson.

**Thoughts**: The next day of jQuery showed me a few more things I hadn't seen before. Functions such as... .remove(), .appendTo(), .clone(), .parent(), .children(). I get the feeling you can do some pretty powerful selections from what I've seen. I'm still a bit curious about the library since this was only about 18 mini challenges.

### Day 85, January 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I researched a project to complete, and I staged for the project.

**Thoughts**: Althought I'm not regularly tweeting, as I really should be, I am maintaining a pretty regular presence coding. Really, I'm almost there. Just need to push through and keep coming up with ideas.

### Day 86, January 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the URL shortening project. I added HTML, broke it into sections, and added a small amount of styling.

**Thoughts**: Back to formatting website elements. It still isn't a natural thing, but I think with enough practice it will be better. Flexbox, flexbox, flexbox. I don't know how I don't have it all memorized yet.
