**Today's Progress**: Reached a stopping point with the Easybank Landing Page. I would say... it's complete for now.

**Thoughts**: I had a sense of urgency to bring this to a stopping point. It's not my finest work, and there is definitely some finer details I could incorporate to make my page look like Frontend Mentor's. BUT, I wouldn't say I'm displeased because really, it does look decent. Icebox items would be: responsiveness! finer details such as padding, spacing between social media icons, font sizes.
