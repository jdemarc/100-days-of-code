### Day 20, November 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reached a stopping point with the Easybank Landing Page. I would say... it's complete for now.

**Thoughts**: I had a sense of urgency to bring this to a stopping point. It's not my finest work, and there is definitely some finer details I could incorporate to make my page look like Frontend Mentor's. BUT, I wouldn't say I'm displeased because really, it does look decent. Icebox items would be: responsiveness! finer details such as padding, spacing between social media icons, font sizes.

### Day 21, November 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Python today! I am going through an e-book, [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), and made it through about 2 chapters. I completed two challenges and made some good progress on the third.

**Thoughts**: I believe that I spent my time very well today. I would read a chapter and attempt to do the coding 'projects'. There are no answers to the projects (that I know of), so I was forced to really think about the solutions. This is big.
