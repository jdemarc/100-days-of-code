### Day 20, November 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reached a stopping point with the Easybank Landing Page. I would say... it's complete for now.

**Thoughts**: I had a sense of urgency to bring this to a stopping point. It's not my finest work, and there is definitely some finer details I could incorporate to make my page look like Frontend Mentor's. BUT, I wouldn't say I'm displeased because really, it does look decent. Icebox items would be: responsiveness! finer details such as padding, spacing between social media icons, font sizes.

### Day 21, November 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Python today! I am going through an e-book, [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), and made it through about 2 chapters. I completed two challenges and made some good progress on the third.

**Thoughts**: I believe that I spent my time very well today. I would read a chapter and attempt to do the coding 'projects'. There are no answers to the projects (that I know of), so I was forced to really think about the solutions. This is big.

### Day 22, November 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed coinflip streak and character picture grid challenge concluding the list chapter of [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). I started working on a dictionary challenge.

**Thoughts**: I got a bit frustrated with the coinflip, and I needed to check out the StackOverflow. The confusion related more to what the question was asking. Was it the number of 6 streaks in 100 or just if a streak of 6 occurs? Does 7+ count as a streak? I settled with a response I found and have referenced in the file.

### Day 23, November 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started working on the functional programming section of FCC's curriculum. I got about 4 lessons done.

**Thoughts**: I'm bouncing around more than I'd like. I need to really stick to one language and stay on it. I'm being pulled in a few different directions lately which is the reason for my... inconsistency. I'm thinking I just slow down, stick to one, and chill. But which one!?

### Day 24, November 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked through some Hackerrank Challenges today. Counting Valleys, Jumping on the Clouds, and Arrays: Left Rotation were among the challenges.

**Thoughts**: These challenges are, for sure, humbling. That's about all I have to say on that... My primary goal for these is to accomplish the task. Refinement will come later.
