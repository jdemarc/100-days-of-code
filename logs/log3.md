### Day 13, November 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was able to figure out why my tests did not work in the tutorial I was following... React tests and non-react tests behave differently. While trying to find an appropriate app to continue messing with Cypress, I reviewed Express and decided to use a simple Express Todo app.

**Thoughts**: Today was super frustrating. It took cloning the repo I was following to really figure out the reason why my tests didn't work, and then I realized it had to do with the fact they were using the react-redux version of 'Real World.io'. I spent a significant amount of time just trying to read things surrounding the problem, and I didn't get much code done at all. But... I did manage to start testing on a non-react app I had so I ended on a good note.

### Day 14, November 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the remaining basic algorithm scripting section of FCC, and I started going through the Object Oriented Programming lesson. I also set up for a front end project for the near future.

**Thoughts**: I was much more motivated to code today than yesterday. I must have been irritable yesterday--the heat, animals being restless, not understanding code properly--but today was better. You gotta have bad days to have good days.

### Day 15, November 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed the Object Oriented Programming Section. I reviewed things such as inheritance, IIFEs, and closures.

**Thoughts**: Most of the education I've received did not dive as far into the prototype property of objects. I also have not seen much use of closures, but I have seen the use of IIFE's as modules. It's interesting to see what gets covered across different educating platforms.

### Day 16, November 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started coding Frontend Mentor's [Easybank Landing Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN). Completed the nav bar and started getting into the intro/header section.

**Thoughts**: I would like to get strong with HTML and CSS, so this is how I'll do it. I read lessons, but I'm more of a doer. do-er. dougher.

### Day 17, November 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on my Easybank Landing Page. I made some big moves with object-fit, which I had previously not used. I *think* I completed the 'intro' section of the page.

**Thoughts**: I was able to explore some CSS I typically did not use. object-fit, object-position, position: absolute specifically. It was a little frustrating at first, spamming dev tools and trying to add properties to see what worked but eventually I got something pretty darn good looking.

### Day 18, November 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started reviewing Python due to some life circumstances which warranted looking back at the language. I spent some time on websites such as [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) and [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm) working through the very basics again.

**Thoughts**: I definitely need some refresher with Python after having been on full blast JS for the past weeks. It's true, I was in the middle of a front end challenge, but I will need to return to that once I have completed my Python review. I would like to get to the point of being able to complete some coding challenges with Python and then I will come back to the Easybank Landing page.  Alternatively, I could work on Python during one period and Easybank in a separate session. We'll see how I feel.

### Day 19, November 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Session 1: Completed the second section of the landing page, styling and content. Began working on the third section, latest articles.
Session 2: Python... for a long time. I completed all of HackerRank's tutorial Python challenges.

**Thoughts**:
Session 1: I'm trying to think of different ways to containerize my CSS. Most of the time, I just want to throw a class on it. Maybe that is a way, but I'm a minimalist at heart, so I want to see what I can do. I can definitely condense some of the classes for the EasyBank landing page. What I have right now just gets the elements where I want them.

Session 2: I'm too tired to write a cohesive summary. So, here's a little list.
- It's a little confusing switching between two languages.
- Python feels a bit more intuitive and looks cleaner.
- I need more time with the built in methods.
