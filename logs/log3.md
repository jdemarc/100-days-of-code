### Day 13, November 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was able to figure out why my tests did not work in the tutorial I was following... React tests and non-react tests behave differently. While trying to find an appropriate app to continue messing with Cypress, I reviewed Express and decided to use a simple Express Todo app.

**Thoughts**: Today was super frustrating. It took cloning the repo I was following to really figure out the reason why my tests didn't work, and then I realized it had to do with the fact they were using the react-redux version of 'Real World.io'. I spent a significant amount of time just trying to read things surrounding the problem, and I didn't get much code done at all. But... I did manage to start testing on a non-react app I had so I ended on a good note.
