### Day 13, November 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was able to figure out why my tests did not work in the tutorial I was following... React tests and non-react tests behave differently. While trying to find an appropriate app to continue messing with Cypress, I reviewed Express and decided to use a simple Express Todo app.

**Thoughts**: Today was super frustrating. It took cloning the repo I was following to really figure out the reason why my tests didn't work, and then I realized it had to do with the fact they were using the react-redux version of 'Real World.io'. I spent a significant amount of time just trying to read things surrounding the problem, and I didn't get much code done at all. But... I did manage to start testing on a non-react app I had so I ended on a good note.

### Day 14, November 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the remaining basic algorithm scripting section of FCC, and I started going through the Object Oriented Programming lesson. I also set up for a front end project for the near future.

**Thoughts**: I was much more motivated to code today than yesterday. I must have been irritable yesterday--the heat, animals being restless, not understanding code properly--but today was better. You gotta have bad days to have good days.

### Day 15, November 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed the Object Oriented Programming Section. I reviewed things such as inheritance, IIFEs, and closures.

**Thoughts**: Most of the education I've received did not dive as far into the prototype property of objects. I also have not seen much use of closures, but I have seen the use of IIFE's as modules. It's interesting to see what gets covered across different educating platforms.

### Day 16, November 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started coding Frontend Mentor's [Easybank Landing Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN). Completed the nav bar and started getting into the intro/header section.

**Thoughts**: I would like to get strong with HTML and CSS, so this is how I'll do it. I read lessons, but I'm more of a doer. do-er. dougher.
