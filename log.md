# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
To get started, I began by blazing through freecodecamp.org's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.  I started at 0 percent and ended at 32%. If I learned anything, it was concretely that strings are immutable. Worth? I think so.  Otherwise, the session was spent mostly revisiting proper terminology (for example, 'assignment operator')

**Thoughts:**
I could have easily started at a much more difficult spot. But, I wanted to kind of ease myself into it.  Without a doubt, things will become challenging quickly. I think it's vitally important for me to understand every aspect of the basics before I continue so that's why I decided to start where I did. In terms of how I felt, I felt like I was kind of wasting my time. At the same time, this is a new thing so a large part of it is simply developing the habit.

### Day 1: October 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
I made some good progress again today. Started back up with arrays. I managed to go from 32% to 66%. I know it's not a race, but I feel pretty eager to get back to the challenging stuff. Today's session went over some basic array manipulation, how to access elements, function declaration and invocation, and conditional logic.

**Thoughts**:
Take-aways... shift removes stuff from the front of an array, unshift adds stuff to the front of an array. Parameters are not arguments. Strict equality/inequality versus non-strict. Logic matters when performing if else statements. Still slightly feeling behind the curve, but you gotta have your basics down. I'll feel better once I move onto objects and ES6 stuff.
