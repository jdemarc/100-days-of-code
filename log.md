# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
To get started, I began by blazing through freecodecamp.org's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.  I started at 0 percent and ended at 32%. If I learned anything, it was concretely that strings are immutable. Worth? I think so.  Otherwise, the session was spent mostly revisiting proper terminology (for example, 'assignment operator')

**Thoughts:**
I could have easily started at a much more difficult spot. But, I wanted to kind of ease myself into it.  Without a doubt, things will become challenging quickly. I think it's vitally important for me to understand every aspect of the basics before I continue so that's why I decided to start where I did. In terms of how I felt, I felt like I was kind of wasting my time. At the same time, this is a new thing so a large part of it is simply developing the habit.
