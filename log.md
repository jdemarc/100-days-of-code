# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
To get started, I began by blazing through freecodecamp.org's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.  I started at 0 percent and ended at 32%. If I learned anything, it was concretely that strings are immutable. Worth? I think so.  Otherwise, the session was spent mostly revisiting proper terminology (for example, 'assignment operator')

**Thoughts:**
I could have easily started at a much more difficult spot. But, I wanted to kind of ease myself into it.  Without a doubt, things will become challenging quickly. I think it's vitally important for me to understand every aspect of the basics before I continue so that's why I decided to start where I did. In terms of how I felt, I felt like I was kind of wasting my time. At the same time, this is a new thing so a large part of it is simply developing the habit.

### Day 1: October 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
I made some good progress again today. Started back up with arrays. I managed to go from 32% to 66%. I know it's not a race, but I feel pretty eager to get back to the challenging stuff. Today's session went over some basic array manipulation, how to access elements, function declaration and invocation, and conditional logic.

**Thoughts**:
Take-aways... shift removes stuff from the front of an array, unshift adds stuff to the front of an array. Parameters are not arguments. Strict equality/inequality versus non-strict. Logic matters when performing if else statements. Still slightly feeling behind the curve, but you gotta have your basics down. I'll feel better once I move onto objects and ES6 stuff.

### Day 2, Session 1: October 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Started at 66% and end at 84% of FCC's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. I briefly reviewed switch statements and then got into objects. I reviewed objects and how to access, update, and delete them. I completed a few challenges and organized my material a bit more.
Switch Statements, Objects

**Thoughts**:
Finally, I got to start thinking a bit more critically. I'm practicing a cycle of "do it, do it right, and do it better" which I definitely was able to use for the two challenges I got done today. I spent a bit more time than an hour today, but that's because I wanted to really check out the answers to the challenges and understand the improved solutions.

### Day 2, Session 2: October 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
Had the time, so I figured I'd keep coding. Percentage wise, I went from 84 to 92. I finished another challenge using loops and objects, and I make sure I can repeat them a few times. I also got to review recursion a bit.

**Thoughts**:
Manipulating objects in a realistic way does not seem very intuitive to me. But, it just means I need to practice them more. I think I solidified my understanding of the recursive base case at least.
